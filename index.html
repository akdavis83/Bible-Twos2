  <h1>Bible Two's 2</h1>
  <p>
    <b>(Matthew 23:15) Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. </b>(Psalms 149:6) Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand;
  </p><p>
    (Proverbs 5:4) But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.
  </p><p>        
    (Hebrews 4:12) For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  </p><p>
        (Revelation 1:16) And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.
  </p><p>
    (Matthew 6:24)  No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
  </p><p>
    Matthew 10:10 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.
  </p><p>
    (Matthew 10:29) Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.  </p><p>
    
  </p><p>
    <b>(Matthew 18:8) Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. </b> (Matthew 18:9) And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
  </p><p>
(Matthew 18:16) But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  </p><p>
      
  </p><p>
 (1 Corinthians 6:16) What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. </p><p>
    
  </p><p>
     (Matthew 18:19) Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
 </p><p>
    (Matthew 18:20) For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
  </p><p>      
    (Matthew 24:41) Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
  </p><p>
    (Matthew 26:2) Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
